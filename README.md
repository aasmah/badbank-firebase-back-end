# Project Title: badbank-firebase-back-end


##Description/Motivation: Bad Bank is a Capstone Project for Module 27 in the MIT - Fullstack Development with MERN. The name “Bad Bank” refers to the intentional exposure of user data in the UI. The project consists of a simple React application where we apply concepts such as hooks, context, routing, and form validations. The front-end components are connected to the back-end through a server. The application is containerized with Docker and uses MongoDB for the database and/or firebase. The express server and node modules are used to put it all together.
